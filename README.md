# Time Maximizer
Welcome to my time maximizer project. This project is an attempt to help manage time in an effort to maximize learning in small windows of time. 
An example is if you know you want to learn about starting a business in your state you might load up the database with small and large web articles
about how to get a business setup in your state. The time maximizer will then send you articles based on a set of triggers (time, and status in slack).
For example at 2:30 it might send you a list of articles via sms that are 30+ minute long reads. Another example is that in the morning you might post
"/me brb" in slack and the maximizer be notified and would send you a list of really short articles 10+ minutes long to read. Likewise you might post 
"I'm done for today" in slack and the maximizer would send you some 30+ minute articles for your commute home. 

This is a work in progress and is a space for me to remedy my lack of experience in Node.js. If you have suggestions or a really cool idea please feel free 
to post on it in github.
